## Cli based code snippet manager

This will eventually be a code snippet application run from the command line.

### Features
* Menu based if no arguments passed
* Auto complete based on python prompt_toolkit

### Setting development dependencies

I used pipenv for managing the python modules
You can add all modules by running
```bash
pipenv install
```
Then you can create the virtual environment by running
```bash
pipenv shell
```
